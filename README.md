I'm playing around with creating a **standalone AI agent** — that's what this project is.

Stack: **React, Node, TypeScript.**

## Guidelines

- **Radical Simplicity**: Keep code minimal, avoid over-engineering, prefer straightforward solutions
- **Testing**: Unit tests only needed for flaky code – focus on complex logic, edge cases, and error-prone areas

## Getting started

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- **Ollama**: local LLM runtime → `http://localhost:11434`
- **Open WebUI**: chat UI → `http://localhost:3000`
